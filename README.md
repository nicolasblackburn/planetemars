An unfinished Zelda-ish sci-fi game that I made in javascript.

The whole engine, collisions and animations were programmed from scratch in javascript. Graphics meticulously drawn pixel by pixel using <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</a>. I used <a href="http://www.mapeditor.org/">Tiled</a> editor to create the map and export the data to json format. Lots of stuff still to be done. Might continue it some day when I have more time.

Use 'w', 'a', 's', 'd' to move, 'space' to fire bullets.
